Udacity Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree

this repository includes projects completed within the Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program.

The first project was the **Explore US Bikeshare Data**, in which I used Python to understand U.S Bikeshare Data, calculating a number of statistics, as well as building an interactive environment for users to choose the dataset to analyze, and perform filters on it.
