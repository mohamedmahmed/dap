## Udacity Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree

This repository includes projects completed within the **Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program**.

The first project was the **Explore US Bikeshare Data**, in which I used Python to understand U.S Bikeshare Data, calculating a number of statistics, as well as building an interactive environment for users to choose the dataset to analyze, and perform filters on it.

This project is found in the bikeshare.py file.
